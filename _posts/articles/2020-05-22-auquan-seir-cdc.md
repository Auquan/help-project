As of today, Auquan's modified SEIR model, created by HELP members [Chandini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandinijain/) and [Vishal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishaltomar28/), has started contributing to the CDC's ensemble predictions. It is in good company, with other contributing models created by teams at: MIT, John Hopkins, Imperial and Columbia. 

The CDC describes the disease predictions as vital and that "forecasts of deaths will help inform public health decision-making by projecting the likely impact in coming weeks."

Although this is a great achievement for our team, we still strongly believe in building on other people's work rather than reinventing it. Accordingly the HELP team still plans to take a modular approach to disease modelling, using whichever model is best suited to the specific lockdown strategy.
