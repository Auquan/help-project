Please see the spec below. If you have any comments or advice, feel free to get in touch by the contact section. If it doesn't load properly [view on google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19_qCecSrjTl8SIGDOnYTiLAM_5zs1bFDszn4s9ukT7Q/edit?usp=sharing)

UPDATE 24/06: Based on continued work and discussions with our economic advisors we have decided to abandon this approach, instead directly working towards an agent based model. Therefore, this spec no longer accurately describes the work we are doing.
