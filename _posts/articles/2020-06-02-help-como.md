The HELP project is extremely proud to announce that it has joined the Como collective. The Como collective is an initiative set up by academics at Oxford and Columbia that has now grown to include modelling teams in 47 low and middle income countries. The aim is to support these teams in their modelling efforts to affect policy decisions in these countries.

The HELP project will continue it's mission to help people improve their hollistic understanding of the NPIs they enact. This includes immediate health outcomes and economic impact, which leads to more complicated long-term damage.
