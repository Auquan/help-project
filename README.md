# The H.E.L.P. Project
The H.E.L.P project is an open source project that combines domain expertise in health, economics and public policy with machine learning to create a holistic model that returns a quantifiable total impact (health + economic) of every lockdown exit strategy in case of a infectious disease like COVID-19.
If you would like to be a part of this undertaking, project details and registration details can be found [on our website](https://quant-quest.com/landingPage/helpproject)
